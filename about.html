    <h4><span class="about_headings">Something About Me</span></h4>
      <p>Hello, my name is Ling. 
          I was born and raised in China and around the age of 10, 
          my family moved to the United States. 
          Growing up in two different cultures was a unique experience 
          and due to that, I&apos;m able to become someone who is more 
          open-minded, more empathetic, and willing to accept different voices. </p>
      <p>I&apos;ve always wanted to help people and am willing to explore 
        other interests and ideas. In college, I&apos;ve taken many different 
        classes related to different fields. I then decided I wanted to 
        learn more about technology, design, and also Human Resource. </p>
    <p>Many people thought the combination I had was quite a contrast. 
    However, I believe everything is intertwined. 
    I may not be the person who is centric and focused on one path, 
    but that&apos;s okay. I believe having the opportunity to explore 
    different fields allows me to see things from different perspectives. </p>

        <li>Learner</li>
            <ul>
                <li>During my first year at Indiana University, 
                  I was told that I should try to be a learner. 
                  We are learning for ourselves and not for anyone else. 
                  The knowledge we gain will forever be with us and it is 
                  less about learning just to get good grades and more 
                  about having the motivation and interest to learn.</li>
            </ul>
        <li>Respect</li>
            <ul>
                <li>I&apos;ve always been told to “treat others like how you 
                  would like to be treated.” During my life, I&apos;ve met 
                  different kinds of people with different stories and 
                  backgrounds. I learned to respect their choices and who 
                  they are even if I disagree.</li>
            </ul>
        <li>Achievement</li>
            <ul>
                <li>I wanted to find my passion and be able to motivate 
                  myself to become a better person. I want to feel satisfied 
                  with what I&apos;m doing and being able to be recognized.</li>
            </ul>
