  <!--gallery of different things-->
  <p> I have a graphic design cognate with my major 
    and these are some projects I have from class, 
    click on the image to view more details. (ordered with newest project on top)</p>

          <!--Typography: Logo-->
          <section>
            <img class="img_design" src="images/Typography_logo.png"alt="Logo: To explore the interaction between a letterform and a number, 
            I used the capital letter 'A' and number 3. ">
          <p class="description">This is the first project I did in 
              Typography class. We are asked to combine one letterform and one numeral into a single 
              visual unit. This logotype project was to explore and pay attention to letterforms 
              and typefaces. </p>

          <!--Typography: Space and Meaning -->
          <section>
            <img class="img_design" src="images/space_meaning.png" alt="Space and meaning: I used a pair of words, 'Powerful' and 'weak'.">
          <p class="description">
              This project of space and meaning is to explore 
              the meaning of a word or an idea through spacing, sizing, and placement of letter.
              As shown in the image, I used the pair, "Powerful" and "Weak". I really enjoy this 
              project because the process of trying to figure out how to show the meaning of the 
              word itself in the simplest way can be difficult yet, interesting. </p>

          <!-- Studio Art: zine book -->
          <section>
						<img class="img_design" src="images/zine2 copy.png" alt="Zine book: about skin product routine.">
            <p class="description">This project was just for fun. 
              But I personally really enjoy making small scale items. At the end of the book,
              I even created a small pocket to fit in "sample" skin care products that's 
              been shown throughout the page. </p>

          <!-- Studio Art: small size large scale-->

						<img class="img_design" src="images/small:large5 copy.jpg" alt="Small size large scale project: 
            small size silhouette of cat and a mice place across from each other on the grided wire board.">
          <p class="description">This is a small size large scale project I did in Studio Art class. 
              I had the opportunity to play withh miniature figures and interact with everyday objects in my environment.

          <!-- Studio Art: collage1 -->

						<img class="img_design" src="images/Final collage copy.jpg" alt="First collage project: square size with chinese and english negative terms 
            organized diagonally towards the right hand corner, there's a colorful umbrella with different poms. ">
          <p class="description">First time trying collage, I wanted 
              to express the idea of trying to stay positive and be yourself 
              even if there's negative comments and voices. Collage allows me to explore 
            various elements such as composition, balance of unity and repetition by using 
          the principles of design. </p>

            the colors are yellow, green, blue, and pink."> 
            <p class="description">This is my Tensegrity project for my studio art class. 
              We were asked to construct a 3-dimensional structure that balance out the tension and create stability.
