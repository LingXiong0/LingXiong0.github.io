  <h1 class="all_h1">Serve IT Summer Intern</h1>
    <div class="container_SIT">
      <h3> Project Background </h3> 
      <p>This was my first intern through Indiana University with 
        Serve IT, it's a summer internship that's mainly for training
        and familiarization with different tools and the process of UX design.
        This project is made up of a team of five and we are in charge of redesigning
         a food pantry website. 
      </p>
  
      <h3> Roles & Tools </h3> 
      <ul>
        <li> Roles: Research, Communication, Web Design</li>
        <li> Team: Yes </li>
        <li> Tools: Trello, Slack, Notion, Figma, WordPress, LinkedIn, Element Pro, Adobe Illustrator, Google Doc</li>
        <li> Duration: 12 week (Summer Term) </li>
      </ul> 
  
      <h3> Overview </h3>
      <ul>
        <li> SiteMaps </li>
        <li> Research & Document</li>
        <li> Style Guides </li>
        <li> Wireframes </li>
        <li> Mobile Responsiveness </li> 
        <li> Final </li> 
        <li> Summary </li> 
      </ul> 

      <h3> <mark> SiteMaps </mark> </h3>
      <p>To start out our team wanted see a preview of what we neeed to do about this website 
        where to start our process. To do that, we decided to use Figma to create a Sitemap. 
        To clearly distinguish each individual's role, we also color coded the section we needs to work on. </p>

          <img src="images/Sitemap.png"alt="">

        </figure>

      <h3> <mark>Research & Document </mark></h3>
      <p> After figuring out what we need to do we met with our client 
        and we also drafted a google doc to document everything we might need 
        to know about the website to redesign it. We took in information from each 
        page on the original website and answered some questions about the mission, 
        purpose, social media communication, operation, and any outside resources that 
        may affect the functionality and layout of the website. 
      </p>

      <h3> <mark> Style Guides </mark></h3>
      <p> Next, our team decided to put together a style guide. We decide on the 
        color, fonts, and the general layout of the site. There was also additional 
        information to read and watch about how to design and create a style guide 
        and why it was necessary for our team. 
      </p>
 <!--this is a star emoji--> 
      <aside> &#x2B50; While I was working and reading information about style guides, 
        It didn't came up to me that website accessibility has a lot to do with 
        color contrast and font styles. Which I would like to keep that in mind 
        from now on. 
      </aside>

      <h3> <mark> Wireframes </mark> </h3>
      <p> For Wireframes we did Low-Fidelity and Medium-Fidelity wireframing. Wireframes helps 
        our team to see the connection better between informations on the site and how it 
        should or can look once it's set. 
        
      </p>

      <h3> <mark> Mobile Responsiveness </mark> </h3> 
      <p> Besides wireframing, we were also trained to learn about mobile responsiveness. This 
        is an important step to give users a better user experience with websites. It's asking 
        us to pay attention to different screen sizes and adjust our website layout for easier 
        access for the users and reduce frustration. 
      </p>

      <h3> <mark> Final </mark> </h3> 
      <p>During redesigning process we went back to the website and recheck things that might be
        easily forgotten, such as image alt text. Compare to the original website, we did a lot 
        of changes including menu links, color scheme, font styles, and layout etc.

      <h2> Summary </h2> 
      <p>During this internship class with Serve IT, I learned a lot of useful skills and 
        familiarized myself with different tools that I didn't before. I also learned more 
        about cooperation and have a better understanding of user experience and web 
        design. I appreciate this opportunity that was given to me and will remember what I learned.
